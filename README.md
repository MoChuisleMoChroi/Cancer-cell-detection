Data mining 2
The objective is to develop a regression model for predicting the number of six different types of cells in a given histological image patch. 
The task is to develop a machine learning model that uses training data (patch images with given cell counts) to predict cell counts of each type in test images. 
Counts of different types of cells in a given image patch is called its cellular composition.
This project is done in different sections.
